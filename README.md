# nyc_payroll Project

A initiative to consolidate payroll data across all of the City of New York's agencies is about to get underway. The City of New York hopes to achieve two main goals by creating a data analytics platform. The organization plans to preserve its data by utilizing a data warehouse architecture to guarantee centralized data administration, improve data accuracy and quality, perform historical data analysis, and facilitate better decision making.
